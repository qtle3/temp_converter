# Temperature Conversion Project

This repository contains Python scripts for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The project includes both command-line and graphical interfaces.

## Overview

- **Command-Line Interface (`temp_convert.py`):**
  - Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
  - Supports both conversion directions with interactive prompts.

- **Graphical User Interface (`temp_convert_gui.py`):**
  - Provides a GUI for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit using the `graphics.py` module.
  - Features input fields, buttons, and real-time feedback for conversions.
  - Includes "Convert It" and "Quit" buttons for user interaction.

- **Custom Graphics Library (`graphics.py`):**
  - Used to create the GUI with basic drawing functions for windows, text, and shapes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **graphics.py**: Include this file in the same directory as the scripts.

### Running the GUI Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qtlee/temp_converter.git
   cd temp_converter
